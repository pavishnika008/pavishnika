        Coimbatore, sometimes shortened as Kovai, is one of the major metropolitan cities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the banks of the Noyyal River and surrounded by the Western Ghats. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai in terms of population and the 16th largest urban agglomeration in India as per the census 2011. It is the administrative capital of Coimbatore District and is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation which was established in 1981.

The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu.[8] The Kosar tribe mentioned in the 2nd century CE Tamil epic Silappathikaram and other poems in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region.[9] The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.[10][11] The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century. A Chola highway called Rajakesari Peruvazhi ran through the region.[12][13] Much of Tamil Nadu came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. In the 1550s, Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an independent kingdom. They introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams(towns).

Location: Coimbatore to Pollachi NH-209 Road, Eachanari

    <h3>Famous Foods in Covai</h3>
    <b>Ghee Roast Dosa</b>
    <p>
        You know it’s going to be a good day when it begins with a fresh-off-the-griddle dosa, paper-thin and crisp as the summer sun. Bonus points if it’s doused in ghee and folded into a towering cone. Coimbatore’s menus are packed with roast dosa options: onion, potato masala, rava (semolina), and more. Whatever your pick,
scoop it up with tangy sambar, coconut chutney, and green coriander chutney. Try it at: Sree Annapoorna, an iconic eatery with several branches across the city.

    <b>Arisi Paruppu Sadam</b>
    <p>
        A homestyle rice-and-lentil dish, this age-old recipe is a quick one-pot creation found in most homes, often served with rasam, pickles, papad, and curd. After a long day, a meal of rice and toor (pigeon pea) dal tempered with mustard seeds, onions, and garlic is like a warm hug in a bowl. Try it at: Pavizham Restaurant, known for its simple, hearty fare.

    <b>Pallipalayam Chicken
    </b>
    <p>
        A Kongunadu speciality from the town of Pallipalayam, this traditional dry chicken dish packs a punch. As is typical in Kongu cuisine, the meat is never marinated. The dish champions local ingredients. Chunks
of chicken are fried in minimal oil with shallots, garlic, chillies, and ribbons of coconut. Best paired with rice and rasam for a wholesome, snooze-inducing lunch. Try it at: Haribhavanam, known for serving Kongunadu cuisine.

    <br><b>Elaneer Payasam
    </b>
    <p>
        Arguably, nothing rounds off a meal as perfectly as a silken payasam. Did you know that, traditionally, payasam was served at the beginning of a typical banana leaf meal? There are many varieties of this dessert—some flavoured with cardamom, others with crushed pistachios and crunchy vermicelli. The indulgent elaneer payasam features the star ingredient of Kongu cuisine—the coconut. ‘Elaneer’ means tender coconut water, and this payasam uses the coconut’s flesh and water
to create a wholly unique local delicacy. Try it at: Shree Aksshayam,
a fuss-free eatery in the city.
