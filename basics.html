        <em>[28-02-2024 11:05] : The field of invention for the project titled </em><b>"Instantaneous private network transfer via personal handshake using RedTacton"</b> falls under the domain of human-computer interaction<u> (HCI) </u>and networking technologies. Specifically, it involves the integration of RedTacton technology, which enables communication through human touch, with the goal of establishing instantaneous private network connections between devices.<ins> This project likely focuses on the development and implementation of protocols, algorithms, and hardware/software systems that facilitate secure and rapid data transfer between devices using RedTacton-enabled handshakes</ins>.<br>RedTacton, on the other hand, is a novel technology that uses the human body as a medium for communication. <i>It enables data transfer by transmitting digital signals through the skin's surface using a weak electric field. This method offers a potentially secure and direct way to exchange data between devices<strong> without the need for physical connections or traditional networks.</i></strong>
